        "The curse of dimensionality refers to the exponential increase in the required network size as the input dimension (d) grows, making it difficult to approximate functions accurately. Specifically, to achieve an accuracy of \\u025b > 0, the network size N needs to increase exponentially with respect to d, represented as N = O(\\u025b-d/(k+s)), where k and s describe the smoothness of the function. This poses a significant challenge in approximating functions in high-dimensional spaces, particularly in classical smoothness spaces where exponential dependence on d cannot be avoided.",
        "Mitigation strategies for the curse of dimensionality involve assumptions that limit the behavior of functions in the Fourier domain, considering functions with specific compositional structures, and focusing on approximation accuracy on lower-dimensional submanifolds. Limiting function behavior in the Fourier domain allows for dimension-independent approximation rates, albeit potentially slower.",
        "The Barron class is a set of functions that can be approximated by neural networks without suffering from the curse of dimensionality, characterized by a specific type of bounded variation. It is defined as the set of functions f \\u2208 L\\u00b9(Rd) such that their Fourier transform satisfies \\u222bRd |2\\u03c0\\u03be||f(\\u03be)|d\\u03be < C for some C > 0. The approximation rate for functions in the Barron class does not directly depend on the dimension d, and the proof relies on properties of high-dimensional convex sets described by the Caratheodory theorem, which states that any point in the convex hull of a set can be represented as a convex combination of a limited number of points from that set.",
        "Functions with compositional structure are constructed by composing many low-dimensional functions, where a directed acyclic graph G with M vertices \\u03b71,..., \\u03b7M represents the structure, and functions fj associated with each vertex depend only on m variables. This is a realistic assumption in sensor networks where local information is aggregated in smaller clusters. This allows for an error convergence rate of O(N-k/m) with a constant depending on the number M of vertices, mitigating the curse of dimensionality by confining it to the input dimension of the subfunctions.",
        "Approximating functions on manifolds involves functions defined on a high-dimensional space Rd but restricted to an m-dimensional manifold M \\u2286 Rd, where the approximation error is determined by m rather than d. The manifold M is assumed to be a smooth, compact m-dimensional manifold in Rd. By focusing on the intrinsic dimension m of the manifold, rather than the ambient dimension d, the curse of dimensionality can be mitigated."

The approximation error decreases as the network size N increases, independently of the input dimension d, offering a way to circumvent the curse of dimensionality under certain assumptions on the function's structure, as demonstrated by the error bound in Theorem 8.1. The approximation rate for Barron functions can be improved under certain assumptions on the activation function, such as using powers of the ReLU activation function, as indicated in Remark 8.2.",
