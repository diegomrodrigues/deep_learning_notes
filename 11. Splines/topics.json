        "Splines serve as a foundational concept in approximation theory, offering a method to approximate continuous functions with arbitrary accuracy using a superposition of piecewise polynomial basis functions. Approximation theory establishes trade-offs between function properties (e.g., smoothness), approximation accuracy, and the number of parameters needed to achieve this accuracy, offering insights into neural network approximation capabilities. Universal approximation theorems state that sufficiently large neural networks can approximate any continuous function with arbitrary accuracy, raising questions about the ideal size and architecture for a given function and desired accuracy.",
        "B-splines are a specific type of spline constructed by shifting and dilating a cardinal B-spline, resulting in a system of univariate splines. Taking tensor products of these univariate splines yields multivariate B-splines, extending the approximation capabilities to higher-dimensional spaces. The order of the B-spline is closely linked to the concept of depth in neural networks, influencing the complexity and architecture required for approximation. The univariate cardinal B-spline of order n is defined as a piecewise polynomial function, constructed using the ReLU activation function and binomial coefficients, providing a basis for representing smooth functions. The dictionary of B-splines of order n, denoted as Bn, comprises a set of shifted and dilated B-splines, enabling the representation of smooth functions through superpositions of these basis elements.",
        "The number of parameters in B-spline approximation determines the approximation accuracy, with an exponential dependence on dimension referred to as the 'curse of dimensionality'. Specifically, achieving an accuracy of \u03b5 > 0 requires O(\u03b5^(-d/k)) parameters, where k is the smoothness and d is the dimension. This highlights a challenge in high-dimensional approximation problems.",
        "Smoother functions can be approximated with fewer B-splines than rougher functions; this more efficient approximation requires the use of B-splines of order n with n \u2265 k, where k is the smoothness parameter, establishing a link between the order of the B-spline and the depth of the neural network. Splines achieve approximation accuracy with a superposition of O(\u03b5^(-d/k)) piecewise polynomial basis functions.",
        "Certain sigmoidal neural networks can match the approximation performance of splines in terms of network size, indicating their expressiveness from an approximation-theoretical perspective. Sigmoidal neural networks can match the performance of splines in terms of network size from an approximation-theoretical viewpoint.",
        "Sigmoidal functions of order q are defined as functions with continuous derivatives up to order q-1 and specific asymptotic behavior, enabling approximation of B-splines within neural networks. The rectified power unit (ReLU) is a sigmoidal function of order q, commonly used as an activation function in neural networks, facilitating the approximation of B-splines and other functions. A function \u03c3: R \u2192 R is sigmoidal of order q if it is in C^(q-1)(R) and satisfies specific decay and boundedness conditions related to the power q, influencing the approximation capabilities of neural networks. The rectified power unit x \u2192 ReLU(x)^q is sigmoidal of order q, exemplifying a sigmoidal function commonly used in neural networks and their approximation properties."
