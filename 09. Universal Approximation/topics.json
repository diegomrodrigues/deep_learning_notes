        "Universal approximation refers to the capability of neural networks to approximate virtually any sensible input-output relationship, given sufficient size and complexity. This implies they are not limited to specific types of functions like linear regression, making them a versatile tool in various applications.",
        "A universal approximator is a set of functions H that can approximate any continuous function f to an arbitrary degree of accuracy \\u03b5 on any compact set K. This means that for every f, there exists a g in H such that the supremum of the absolute difference between f(x) and g(x) over K is less than \\u03b5. The Stone-Weierstrass theorem is a key mathematical tool used to prove that certain sets of functions are universal approximators, ensuring that these sets can approximate any continuous function on a compact set to an arbitrary degree of accuracy.",
        "Shallow neural networks, characterized by a single hidden layer with arbitrary width and under certain mild conditions on the activation function, can serve as universal approximators. This means they can approximate any continuous function to a desired degree of accuracy, provided the activation function belongs to the set of piecewise continuous and locally bounded functions (M) and is non-polynomial. The set M encompasses piecewise continuous and locally bounded functions, which serve as activation functions for shallow neural networks, ensuring the universal approximation property. Activation functions like ReLU, SiLU, and Sigmoid, which are continuous and non-polynomial, are suitable for achieving universal approximation in shallow networks, as they belong to the set M.",
        "Deep neural networks extend the universal approximation capability of shallow networks, leveraging the fact that the identity function can be approximated by a shallow network. This allows deep networks to approximate any continuous function by composing shallow approximations of the target and identity functions. Given a continuous function f and a desired accuracy \\u03b5, a deep neural network can be constructed to approximate f such that the maximum difference between f(x) and the network's output is less than \\u03b5 for all x in a compact set, confirming the universal approximation theorem for deep networks.",
        "The universal approximation theorem provides a theoretical foundation for understanding the capabilities of neural networks in approximating continuous functions. Compact convergence is a mode of convergence for sequences of functions, where a sequence of functions converges compactly to a function if, for every compact set, the supremum of the absolute difference between the functions tends to zero. This concept is crucial for analyzing the approximation capabilities of neural networks on compact sets.",
        "Polynomials are dense in C\\u00ba(Rd), meaning that any continuous function on a compact subset of Rd can be uniformly approximated by a polynomial. This property is leveraged in universal approximation theorems to show that neural networks can approximate polynomials, and consequently, any continuous function. Polynomials, due to their density in the space of continuous functions, can serve as universal approximators, indicating their ability to approximate any continuous function on a compact set."

        "Activation functions are crucial in neural networks, and for universal approximation, they must belong to the set M of piecewise continuous and locally bounded functions, including common choices like ReLU, SiLU, and Sigmoid. A key requirement for universal approximation is that the activation function is not a polynomial, as networks with polynomial activation functions are limited in their ability to approximate complex functions.",

        "Deep neural networks, extending beyond shallow networks with multiple hidden layers, inherit the universal approximation capabilities, allowing them to approximate complex functions with increased efficiency. Deep neural networks with single-hidden-layer architecture can be universal approximators with activation functions that are not polynomials, which can approximate every continuous function on compact sets to arbitrary precision, given sufficient width. This capability extends directly to neural networks of any fixed depth L > 1, as the identity function can be approximated by shallow networks.",
        "The approximation of the identity function using shallow neural networks is a key step in demonstrating the universal approximation property of deep networks. By composing shallow neural network approximations of the target function with approximations of the identity function, one can construct deep neural network approximations.",
        "The conditions for universal approximation with deep networks can be relaxed to require only that the activation function is differentiable and not constant on an open set, rather than requiring it to be non-polynomial. This relaxation allows for constructive proofs that yield explicit bounds on the neural network size.",

Kolmogorov's superposition theorem states that any continuous function of d variables can be expressed as a composition of functions that each depend only on one variable. This theorem implies that every continuous function on a compact set KC Rd can be approximated to every desired accuracy using a neural network of size O(d^2), independent of the desired accuracy, the compact set, and the function being approximated.",
