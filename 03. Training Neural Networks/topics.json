        "The training of neural networks involves minimizing an objective function f: Rn \u2192 R, which represents the error between the network's predictions and the actual data. The goal is to find suitable weights and biases, collected in a vector in Rn, to determine a minimizer w* \u2208 Rn such that f(w*) \u2264 f(w) for all w \u2208 Rn. This is typically achieved through iterative optimization algorithms like gradient descent and its variants.",
        "Gradient descent is an iterative optimization algorithm that starts with an initial guess w0 \u2208 Rn and updates the weights sequentially by moving in the direction of the steepest descent of the objective function. The update rule is given by wk+1 := wk - hk\u2207f(wk), where hk > 0 is the step size or learning rate. This can be interpreted as an Euler discretization of the gradient flow w'(t) = \u2212\u2207f(w(t)) for t \u2208 [0, \u221e), which describes the movement of a particle w(t) with velocity at time t > 0 equal to the negative gradient \u2212\u2207f(w(t)), ensuring the value of the objective function decreases along its path.",
        "Selecting an appropriate learning rate (step size) is crucial for the convergence of gradient descent. A learning rate that is too small results in slow convergence, while a learning rate that is too high might overshoot the minimum. Common strategies for tuning the learning rate include constant learning rates, decaying learning rates (hk \u2192 0 as k \u2192 \u221e), and adaptive methods that dynamically adjust hk based on the values of f(wj) or \u2207f(wj) for j \u2264 k.",
        "L-smoothness is a key assumption for analyzing the convergence of gradient descent. A function f is L-smooth if its gradient does not change too rapidly. Formally, f is L-smooth if its gradient is Lipschitz continuous, i.e., ||\u2207f(w) \u2013 \u2207f(v)|| \u2264 L||w \u2013 v|| for all w, v \u2208 Rn. This implies a linear growth bound on the gradient. For an L-smooth function f, the function is bounded from above by a quadratic function touching the graph of f at w, as described by f(v) \u2264 f(w) + \u27e8\u2207f(w), v \u2013 w\u27e9 + (L/2)||v \u2013 w||\u00b2 for all w, v \u2208 Rn, and also bounded from below by a similar quadratic function. Under L-smoothness, the values of f necessarily decrease in each iteration of gradient descent, provided the step size hk is small enough and the gradient \u2207f(wk) \u2260 0, as described by the decay property f(wk+1) \u2264 f(wk) - (hk - (L*hk^2)/2) ||\u2207f(wk)||\u00b2.",
        "Convexity is a property of a function f where any point on the line segment connecting two points on the function's graph lies above or on the graph. Formally, f is convex if f(\u03bbw + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)v) \u2264 \u03bbf(w) + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)f(v) for all w, v \u2208 Rn and \u03bb \u2208 (0,1). Convexity ensures that any local minimizer is also a global minimizer. If f \u2208 C\u00b9(Rn), then f is convex if and only if f(w) + \u27e8\u2207f(w), v \u2013 w\u27e9 \u2264 f(v) for all w, v \u2208 Rn. For a convex objective function f, if w* and v* are two minimizers, then every convex combination \u03bbw* + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)v*, \u03bb \u2208 [0, 1], is also a minimizer, and if f \u2208 C\u00b9(Rn) then \u2207f(w) = 0 implies that w is a minimizer of f.",
        "Strong convexity, where f(v) \u2265 f(w) + \u27e8\u2207f(w), v \u2013 w\u27e9 + (\u03bc/2)||v \u2013 w||\u00b2 for all w, v \u2208 Rn, guarantees the existence of a unique minimizer and faster convergence, implying that f is lower bounded by a convex quadratic function, with the condition number \u03ba := L/\u03bc influencing the rate of convergence, and the gradient descent iterates converging linearly towards the unique minimizer.",
        "The Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) inequality, expressed as (\u03bc/2)(f(w) \u2013 f(w*)) \u2264 ||\u2207f(w)||\u00b2 for all w \u2208 Rn, provides a weaker condition than strong convexity for linear convergence, bounding the distance to the minimal value of the objective function by the squared norm of the gradient, and giving a convergence result for L-smooth functions without requiring convexity.",
        "Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is an iterative optimization algorithm that approximates the gradient of the objective function using a random subset of the data. The update rule is given by wk+1 := wk - hkGk, where Gk is an unbiased estimator of the gradient \u2207f(wk) such that E[Gk|wk] = \u2207f(wk) and hk > 0 is the step size or learning rate. SGD is commonly used to reduce the computational cost and storage requirements of training neural networks. In empirical risk minimization, the gradient \u2207f(w) is replaced by G := (1/m) \u03a3j\u2208J (\u03c6(xj, w) \u2013 yj)\u2207w\u03c6(xj, w), where J is a random subset of {1, ..., m} of cardinality mb, to decrease computational complexity. Convergence statements for SGD are stochastic, focusing on convergence in expectation, and under certain conditions, such as L-smoothness, \u03bc-strong convexity, and a uniform bound on the estimator's variance, the expected squared distance to the minimizer and the expected difference between the function value and the minimum decay at a rate of O(k\u207b\u00b9).",
        "Backpropagation is an efficient algorithm for computing the gradients of the loss function with respect to the neural network parameters, involving a forward pass to compute activations and a backward pass to compute gradients, and it relies on the chain rule to calculate the derivatives of the loss function with respect to the weights and biases. The algorithm introduces intermediate variables \u03b1(l), representing the gradient of the loss function with respect to the preactivations at each layer, and computes these variables recursively during the backward pass, using the derivatives of the activation function and the weight matrices. Backpropagation provides explicit formulas for computing the gradients of the loss function with respect to the weights and biases, expressing these gradients in terms of the \u03b1(l) variables and the activations at each layer, enabling the use of gradient-based optimizers for training neural networks."
