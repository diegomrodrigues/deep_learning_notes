        "The double descent phenomenon describes how the test error (or risk) of a model initially decreases with increasing model complexity (e.g., number of parameters), then increases as the model starts to overfit the training data, and finally decreases again as the model becomes heavily overparameterized, surpassing the interpolation threshold. This challenges classical statistical learning theory, which suggests that increasing model complexity beyond a certain point always leads to overfitting; deep learning models often operate in the overparameterized regime and still achieve good generalization.",
        "The interpolation threshold is a critical point in the double descent phenomenon, representing the point where the model has enough capacity to perfectly fit (interpolate) the training data, leading to an initial peak in the test error. Before this threshold, in the underparameterized regime, the model has fewer parameters than training data points and cannot perfectly fit the training data, resulting in non-zero training error. The test error decreases with increasing model complexity as the model better captures the underlying patterns. Beyond the interpolation threshold, in the overparameterized regime, the model has more parameters than training data points and can perfectly fit the training data; surprisingly, the test error decreases again with further increases in model complexity, suggesting that overparameterization can lead to better generalization.",
        "In the classical regime, the model is underparameterized, leading to underfitting and high bias, where the model cannot capture the underlying patterns in the data, resulting in a non-zero minimum empirical risk. As model complexity increases, the model approaches the interpolation threshold, where it can perfectly fit the training data (zero empirical risk), but this often leads to overfitting, where the model performs poorly on unseen data due to high variance. In the modern regime, the model is overparameterized, and the test error starts to decrease again, indicating that overparameterization can lead to better generalization performance."

        "Least-squares regression aims to find the function that minimizes the sum of the squared differences between the predicted values and the actual values in a dataset, providing a way to fit a model to the data. In the context of the double descent phenomenon, least-squares regression can be used to illustrate how the number of parameters in the model (ansatz functions) affects the model's ability to fit the training data and generalize to unseen data. In neural networks, least-squares regression can be used to fit a function to the data using linear least-squares, where the function is a linear combination of basis functions (ansatz functions).",
        "The feature map transforms the input data into a higher-dimensional space, allowing the model to capture more complex relationships in the data. The choice of feature map and the number of features (ansatz functions) influences the model's capacity and its ability to interpolate the training data. In the underparameterized case (fewer parameters than training points), the model cannot perfectly interpolate the data, resulting in a non-zero minimum empirical risk. In the overparameterized case (more parameters than training points), there exist infinitely many parameter choices that yield zero empirical risk; the training algorithm determines the type of prediction function obtained and its generalization performance.",
        "Underparameterization in least-squares regression occurs when the number of ansatz functions (n) is less than the number of training points (m), leading to a model that cannot perfectly fit the data and has a non-zero training error. Overparameterization in least-squares regression occurs when the number of ansatz functions (n) is greater than or equal to the number of training points (m), allowing the model to perfectly fit the training data. However, this can lead to overfitting if the model is not carefully chosen."

        "The norm of the coefficients (weights) in a neural network is related to the complexity and generalization ability of the network. Large weights are generally undesirable because they are often associated with large derivatives or oscillatory behavior in the prediction function, which can lead to poor generalization. The L2-error, which measures the difference between the predicted function and the true function, often peaks at the interpolation threshold, indicating that the model is overfitting the training data.",
        "The Euclidean norm of the coefficient vector also tends to peak at the interpolation threshold, suggesting that the model requires larger weights to perfectly fit the training data at this point. Proposition 15.1 states that under certain conditions, the norm of the minimal norm solution increases monotonically for n < m and decreases monotonically for n \u2265 m, providing a theoretical explanation for the observed behavior of the weights. The norm of the coefficients (weights) exhibits a similar behavior to the L2-error, peaking at the interpolation threshold, indicating that the weights tend to be larger when the model is interpolating the data.",
        "Assuming that the data is generated by a smooth function, large derivatives of the prediction function can lead to poor generalization; however, if the function is not smooth, there is little hope of accurately recovering it from limited data. Under certain assumptions, the norm of the coefficient vector is monotonically increasing for n < m and monotonically decreasing for n \u2265 m, where n is the number of parameters and m is the number of training points."

        "To understand double descent in the context of neural networks, the data is assumed to stem from a CM-Lipschitz continuous function, and architectures of the form (\u03c3ReLU; Ad) are considered, where Ad defines the architecture's dimensions. To derive an upper bound on the risk (generalization error), the empirical risk (training error) is first upper-bounded, and then Theorem 15.2 is applied to establish an upper bound on the generalization gap. These estimates are combined to provide an overall upper bound on the risk.",
        "The upper bound on the empirical risk, Rs(\u03a6A\u0192), is estimated using an Ansatz (an educated guess or approximation) that combines the assumption that Rs(\u03a6) = 0 as soon as na \u2265 log(m)dom with the assumption that Rs(\u03a6) = O(na-1) for na significantly smaller than log(m)dom. An upper bound on the generalization gap is obtained by invoking Theorem 15.2, which provides a bound on the difference between the true risk R(\u03a6) and the empirical risk Rs(\u03a6) in terms of KNN(Ad, m; C1) and KLip(Ad, m; c2), representing complexity measures based on the number of parameters and the Lipschitz constant, respectively.",
        "The overall upper bound on the risk, R(\u03a6A\u0192), is then defined as the sum of the upper bound on the empirical risk and the minimum of the two complexity measures, KNN and KLip, plus a term involving the logarithm of the confidence level divided by the number of samples. To understand the double descent phenomenon in the context of Theorem 15.2, simplifying assumptions are made to obtain a formula for an upper bound on the risk, assuming data stems from a Lipschitz continuous function. The upper bound on the risk combines the empirical risk and the generalization gap, resembling the double descent phenomenon, where the Lipschitz interpolation point is slightly behind the threshold where the empirical risk is assumed to be zero.",
        "Simplifying assumptions are made, such as data stemming from a CM-Lipschitz continuous function and fixing a depth L, to derive an upper bound on the risk. An upper bound on the empirical risk, Rs(\u03a6), is established for \u03a6\u2208 N*(\u2642ReLU; Ad, B) \u2229 Lip(CM), considering that with sufficient depth, a neural network can interpolate m points from a CM-Lipschitz function if na \u2265 Cint log(m)dom. An upper bound on the generalization gap, g(Ad, CoreLU, B, m), is computed using KNN(Ad, m; C1) and KLip(Ad, m; c2), representing different regimes of generalization error based on network complexity and Lipschitz properties. The upper bound on the risk, R(\u03a6\u0100\u0192), is defined as the sum of the empirical risk and the generalization gap, capturing the double descent phenomenon where the risk initially increases and then decreases as model complexity grows.",
        "Analyzing the upper bound involves considering the KNN and KLip terms, representing different regimes of generalization error, and understanding how their interplay leads to the observed double descent behavior. The upper bound on risk, derived from combining empirical risk and generalization gap estimates, clearly resembles the double descent phenomenon, highlighting the importance of the Lipschitz interpolation point and the choice of constants in the model. The Lipschitz interpolation point is slightly behind the interpolation threshold, and the double descent phenomenon is not visible for all choices of parameters, indicating the complexity of the phenomenon and the importance of parameter selection."

When the model has very few parameters, it cannot adequately approximate the Runge function and exhibits a poor fit.",
        "As the number of parameters increases, the model captures the main characteristics of the Runge function but is still unable to interpolate the data, striking a balance between approximation and generalization error. At the interpolation threshold, the model can perfectly interpolate the training data, but the behavior between data points becomes erratic due to overfitting.",

        "The double descent phenomenon describes how, beyond the interpolation threshold, the risk (error) of a neural network starts to decrease again as model complexity increases, defying classical statistical learning theory, which predicts increasing risk. In the underparameterized regime (n < m), the model has fewer parameters (n) than training points (m), leading to a non-zero empirical risk because the model cannot perfectly fit the training data. In the overparameterized regime (n \u2265 m), the model has at least as many parameters as training points, allowing for interpolation of the training data, where multiple minimizers of the empirical risk exist, and the choice of training algorithm determines the generalization performance.",

Least-squares regression provides insights into the double descent phenomenon by analyzing the behavior of the fitted function as the number of ansatz functions varies, distinguishing between underparameterized (n < m) and overparameterized (n \u2265 m) regimes. In the overparameterized case, the existence of multiple minimizers necessitates choosing a specific minimizer (e.g., the minimal 2-norm minimizer) to achieve good generalization and observe double descent, influencing the prediction function's behavior.",
        "Large, overparameterized neural networks tend to be Lipschitz continuous with a Lipschitz constant independent of size, which is a consequence of neural networks typically having relatively small weights. The assumption of the type B \u2264 \u0441\u0432\u00b7 (dCo)\u22121, i.e. a scaling of the weights by the reciprocal 1/d of the width, is not unreasonable in practice, and standard initialization schemes use random weights with variance scaled inverse proportional to the input dimension of each layer.",

In the standard regime, neural networks are considered as a set parameterized by na parameters, leading to a generalization error that scales linearly with na, and good generalization is expected when na is small compared to the number of samples. In the overparameterized regime, neural networks are viewed as a subset of Lip(C) with a covering number bound independent of the number of parameters na, and the generalization error is analyzed using this perspective. Double descent for neural network learning can be understood in the context of Theorem 15.2 by making simplifying assumptions to obtain a formula for an upper bound on the risk, combining bounds on empirical risk and generalization gap.",
        "Theorem 15.2 provides generalization bounds for neural networks, considering both a standard regime (small network size) and an overparameterized regime (large network size, small weights), and it shows how the generalization error behaves in each regime. The C-Lipschitz continuity assumption of neural networks may not hold near the interpolation threshold, potentially leading to an overly optimistic upper bound in Theorem 15.2."
